# Fonts Used

## Material Symbols

Material Symbols are currently part of [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons). The developer guide suggests loading the fonts from Google (because of course they do). In order to provide offline functionality, I needed the font file to ship with the application. The current file was part of a [repository](https://github.com/marella/material-symbols/tree/main/material-symbols) containing all the font file assets, as well as the binary files themselves.

## IBM Plex (Sans, Mono)

Font files for the IBM typeface, across languages and families are currently hosted in a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/IBM/plex).
